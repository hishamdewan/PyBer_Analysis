# Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to use data provided by a private ride-sharing company to draw conclusions about the data and support the company's strategy. The data set is from 2019 and contains information about city type (rural, suburban, and urban), fares, drivers, dates, rides taken, etc. The analysis compares ride sharing data by city type and looks at total fares by city type over time. 

# Results
The following section compares ride sharing statistics by city type and looks at total fares by city type over time. 

## Summary ride sharing activity 
In the chart below, we  an see ride sharing activity such as Total rides, Total driver, and Total fares rank from highest to lowest going from urban to rural cities. However, average fare per ride and average fare per driver are highest for rural cities and lowest among urban cities.

## Total fares by city
When comparing total fares by city type over time, the conclusion is urban cities had the highest total fare among city types, followed by suburban and rural cities. Urban cities seem to be the most mature city type for ride sharing.

# Summary
After analyzing the data, I would have the following three business recommendations to the CEO of PyBer for addressing disparities among the city types:

- Given low number of drivers and high average prices, there is untapped opportunity to expand PyBer's business in rural and suburban areas.  
- Adding more drivers in rural and suburban areas could increase revenue for PyBar. 
- Given cylicality in rider demand throughout the year, PyBer needs to better match number of drivers (i.e. "supply") with riders (i.e. "demand") to improve utilization.
